* TODO org-to-github README file 

This is a small emacs script for exporting org-mode files to github flavored markdown for usage as project README pages or a personal blog using Jekyll. To get started, place org-to-github.el somewhere in your load path, and update your emacs.d to reference it. 

Literate programming is *awesome*! 

** Installing
Place =org-to-github.el= somewhere in your emacs' init file's load path, and then add the following lines to your init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-file "~/code/dotfiles/emacs.d/lisp/org-to-github.el")
  (setq org-publish-project-alist
        (make-org-publish-project-alist
         "blog"
         "~/org/"
         "~/code/lambertington.github.io"))
  (org-publish-project "blog" t)                             
#+END_SRC

Make sure you use =#+OPTIONS: toc:nil= to turn off exporting the ugly table of contents stuff.

*** Custom Options
There's a bunch of vars to set. Umm. I need to implement their functionality first, and then I'll have better documentation. 

* TODO bugs
** TODO exporting the top "post", as it were, also exports some Table of Contents nonsense HTML. Need to get rid of that. 
** TODO implement customization options

* TODO add a license
** TODO It will be GPL

* TODO add thanks to other sources used.
