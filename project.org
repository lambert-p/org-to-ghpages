* TODO org-to-github README file 

This is a small emacs script for exporting org-mode files to github flavored markdown for usage as project README pages or a personal blog using Jekyll. To get started, place org-to-github.el somewhere in your load path, and update your emacs.d to reference it. 

Literate programming is *awesome*! 

** Usage
Place =org-to-github.el= somewhere in your emacs' init file's load path, and then add the following lines to your init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-file "~/code/dotfiles/emacs.d/lisp/org-to-github.el")
  (setq org-publish-project-alist
        (make-org-publish-project-alist
         "blog"
         "~/org/"
         "~/code/lambertington.github.io"))
  (org-publish-project "blog" t)                             
#+END_SRC

Make sure you use =#+OPTIONS: toc:nil= to turn off exporting the ugly table of contents stuff.

*** Custom Options
There's a bunch of vars to set. Umm. I need to implement their functionality first, and then I'll have better documentation. 

* TODO add a license
** TODO It will be GPL

* TODO add thanks to other sources used. 
* TODO Examples
  The following are example outputs for this export mode. You can check the =Examples= subheading in =project.org= and the equivalent =examples.md= for the corresponding GitHub Flavored Markdown export. This file was generated merely by setting =org-github-use-src-plugin= and =org-github-include-yaml-front-matter= both to =nil= before exporting (due to GitHub not supporting Pygments and not
needing frontmatter!)

The usual *bolding* and /italicizing/ works as well, as well as +strikethrough+!

Headings:

** Headline 2
*** Headline 3
**** Headline 4

Inline code: =sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade=

Tagged code-block (with org-github-use-src-plugin set to nil):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defgroup org-export-github nil
    "Options for exporting org-mode files to Github Pages Markdown"
    :tag "Org GitHub Flavored Markdown"
    :group 'org-export
    :version "24.5.1")
#+END_SRC

For blockquotes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

is on GitHub, HackerNews, or Reddit." - Abraham Lincoln
#+END_QUOTE

Lists:

My favorite lists are (in this order):

1. Ones that are succinct
2. Ones that have some practical value
   + Like showing off functionality
   + Or, ideally, providing somewhat useful documentation
3. Ones that eventually end
   - The end is nigh!
   - Important value :: has some importance to somebody
