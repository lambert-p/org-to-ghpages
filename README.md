# org-to-ghpages

This is a small emacs script for exporting org-mode TODO list subtrees to GitHub Flavored Markdown for usage on a Jekyll-powered blog or GitHub project. 

## A Visual Guide

Let's say we have all of our blog posts as `TODO` items in an org file.

This has practical value, as we can get automatic reminders about writing and quickly refactor posts.

Once we're done, we export to GitHub Flavored Markdown for posting to our Jekyll blog using gh-pages!Hit `C-c C-e g G` to put it in a buffer&#x2026;

Or we can just hit `C-c C-e g g` to export it directly to our blog (assuming we've set up our default directory properly).

And bam, that's all you have to do. From here you can run your blog locally to make sure everything's peachy, or just `git push` off to victory.

Easy peasy.

## Quick Start

Place `org-to-ghpages.el` somewhere in your Emacs' load path, and then add the following lines to your init.el:

```common-lisp
(require 'org-to-ghpages)
(setq org-ghpages-post-dir "~/location/of/jekyll/blog/_posts/")
```

(To see a literate example of how *I* use this, please refer to [my init file](https://github.com/lambertington/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/lambert-config.org#external-scripts).)

By default, this library can be invoked by executing `C-c C-e g` from within org-mode on a `TODO` list item. Its default output is designed for GitHub Pages blogs, built upon Jekyll. Namely, it outputs a GitHub Flavored Markdown file to your specified `org-ghpages-post-dir` with smart guesses for YAML front matter data, with the file name of `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`. 

### Custom Options

`org-ghpages-post-dir`: The directory to export posts to. By default, they will be output to your `~/Documents` directory.

```common-lisp
(defcustom org-ghpages-post-dir (expand-file-name "~/Documents")
  "directory to save posts"
  :group 'org-export-ghpages
  :type 'directory)
```

---

`org-ghpages-include-yaml-front-matter`: A boolean to determine whether you want to include YAML front matter. By default, values will include:

```yaml
layout: post
title: The TODO Text
date: date specified by the `Scheduled` agenda date for this TODO item
comments: true
categories: tags taken from org-mode
permalink: the-todo-text
```

If you want to export just a GitHub Flavored Markdown post, i.e. a README, set this value to nil.

`M-x set-variable [RET] org-ghpages-include-yaml-front-matter [RET] nil [RET]`

```common-lisp
(defcustom org-ghpages-include-yaml-front-matter t
  "automatically generate YAML front matter?"
  :group 'org-export-ghpages
  :type 'boolean)
```

---

`org-ghpages-layout`: What the `layout` value in your YAML front matter should be. By default, it is set to "post".

```common-lisp
(defcustom org-ghpages-layout "post"
  "define each top level as a post by default"
  :group 'org-export-ghpages
  :type 'string)
```

---

`org-ghpages-comments`: A boolean to indicate whether you want to include Disqus comments. This choice is reflected in the YAML front matter.

```common-lisp
(defcustom org-ghpages-comments t
  "include disqus comments by default"
  :group 'org-export-ghpages
  :type 'boolean)
```

---

`org-ghpages-use-src-plugin`: A boolean to indicate whether you want source blocks surrounded with Pygments-style tags. 
-   If set to `t` (which is the default), your source blocks will be wrapped with `{% highlight lang %} / {% endhighlight %}` tags, where the value of `lang` is taken from your `#+BEGIN_SRC` declarations.
-   If set to `nil`, it will wrap source blocks with the triple backquotes tags, including `lang` if it is available (again, taken from your `#+BEGIN_SRC` blocks.

```common-lisp
(defcustom org-ghpages-use-src-plugin t
  "if true, uses pygments-style code blocking"
  :group 'org-export-ghpages
  :type 'boolean)
```

### Sensible defaults

Aside from having to set up your default export path (which is used when you use `C-c C-e g g`, or manually invoke `org-ghpages-export-to-gfm`), all of the default settings will work for exporting Jekyll/gh-pages blog posts. 

If you're trying to just export to GitHub Flavored Markdown for use in GitHub Pages (such as creating READMEs for projects), please use:

```common-lisp
(setq org-ghpages-include-yaml-front-matter nil)
(setq org-ghpages-use-src-block-plugin nil)
```

## Examples

To see a practical example of how this is used, please look at `project.org` which is in this repository. I generated both the `README.md` and `examples.md` files aginst this file.

## Requirements

This is built on top of the `ox-md` backend, which requires `org-mode` of at least version 8. I have only tested this with GNU Emacs 24.5.1, but it should work fine with versions 23+.

## Help!

-   If you're getting nasty Table of Contents HTML output with your files, make sure you have `#+OPTIONS: toc:nil` towards the top of your org file.
